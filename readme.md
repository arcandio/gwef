* Issues
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6249095/how-to-set-caretcursor-position-in-contenteditable-element-div
    * tried first and second answers, but not generalizable enough for my conditions (child element regeneration)
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4749146/problem-with-caret-position-when-modifying-a-field-htmljs
    * not relevant
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27380018/when-cmd-key-is-kept-pressed-keyup-is-not-triggered-for-any-other-key?noredirect=1&lq=1
    * no idea

## Fails to load file silently

* seems to be a Webpack problem, changing `data.js` functions seems to sometimes force it to refresh and work. Deleting the webpack folder doesn't seem to affect it though.
* Sometimes it works if you Refresh the app

## Possible Alternative: Proton Native

* no Electron
* uses React
* compiles to native QT
* Can I access the text elements/do my md parsing?
